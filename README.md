### Stacks
- [5_1_Stack.cpp](5_1_Stack.cpp): Stack operations, infix to postfix conversion, palindrome and balance checking.
- [5_2_Stack.cpp](5_2_Stack.cpp): Stack with expression evaluation and more advanced operations.

### Miscellaneous
- [MidQs1.cpp](MidQs1.cpp): Reservation system using stacks, queues, and custom classes.

## How to Use

Each `.cpp` file is self-contained and can be compiled and run independently. Use any C++ compiler (such as g++, clang++, or Visual Studio) to compile the files:

```sh
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

Follow the on-screen menus in each program to interact with the data structures and algorithms.
